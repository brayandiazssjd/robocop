# Question

How can real-life case studies in systems design be used to bridge theory and practice in the field of systems sciences?

# Brainstorm

- Concepts correlation
- Apply concept to build design and apply theory
- Empiric evidente to notice what concepts works better together
- Find, correlate or reinterpret concepts based on concrete study case conditions and it's context

# Answear

I think that real-life case studies act as laboratories, because is where the theory is tested, and the researchers use the findings to conclude and visualize new starting points.
The process of bridgeing theory and practice in the field of systems sciences develops through the case studies analysis and the designs product from the analysis. The analysis is the part where researchers identify useful concepts and the theory that may help to solve the problem in the study case. However the analysis is the asbtract/holistic vision of the solution, and there where is necessery to introduce the designs that will allow to transform the theory in a factible implementable solutions.
Nevertheless, the process of bridging is not linear, it more simliar to a spiral because it is not always possible to make one analysis, one design and getting a solution that solves the problem in the better possible way. As I said, it is more similar to a spiral where the researchers refine the solution throwgh better analysis that imply a better relation between concepts, reinterpret or destil concepts, and maybe define new concepts that could help to solve specific conditions of the context in the study case. But, the bridgeing process continues in the designs that are the specification of the solution, and the implementations helps to test the developed solution. And from that process of feedback where we develop the solution, make a design, implement that design and test how it performs in the context of the study case, we get high value information to complement or refine the theory, and also get better results in the final solutions.

As I said, it is more similar to a spiral where the researchers refine the solution through better analysis that implies a better relation between concepts, reinterpret or distill concepts, and maybe define new concepts that could help to solve specific conditions in the context of the study case.
