System sciences is an interdisciplinary field of three main disciplines, the first is control theory which is related to the concept of dinamic systems, the second is cybernetics with the contribution of feedback loops, and the third is general system theory. They are also another field that emerged from cybernetics discipline, which is Artifitial inteligence "AI". AI is important because adds the problem-solving notion to a system.
Let's explore how those disciplines contribute in their ways, what concepts are behind them, and how they merge to create innovative solutions for complex problems.
- Control Theory: here there are an objetive to develop a model or algorithm to drive a system to a wanted state. Then, in a complex problem is necessery to define a certain degree of optimally to make the solution viable.
- Cybernetics: in few words this field is about the study of circular causal processes. This is important because introduces the feedback loops, and now things like the environment and it's actors are in the horizon to develop a solution that take in count those factors.
- General Systems Theory: this area is about the study of systems, their causal boudaries, their interactions and it's components. This makes more sense when we look the concept of holistics to have a wider view of the problem, and forsee emergent behaviors in the solution that could lead to errors.
Those three disciplines can merge to create innovative solution, where a system is developed to solve the problem. That system must have the capabilities to maintain a desired state (like a policy in AI). To achieve that, it can make use of feedback loops to interact and learn (with AI) from the environment, it's subsystems or another systems. Also, an innovative solution requires a holistic approach to correlate interactions and forsee emergent behaviors.
