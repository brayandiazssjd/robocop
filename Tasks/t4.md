Well, Systems Sciencies is a interdisciplinary field that studies complex systems. Also, complex systems are systems that have several (often a lot) parts and interaction between those parts.
That said, Systems Sciencies can contribute to improve the efficiency, the performance and the sustainabilty of real-world systems providing instruments for the analisys, design, implementation and maintainance of those systems.
I think I can apply the tools systems sciences gives us relying in a strong analysis and design to understand the system. Also, through the analisys is posible to visualize concepts, theories and math models that belongs to systems sciences scope, and enhance the understand and predict behaviours related to the system.
To be more detailed let's explore some tools and how I think they can contribute:
- Holistics: it can contribute to understant the system as a whole. A complex system has many parts and many interaction between those parts. Then, holistics is a tool to correlate the interactions between the parts or subsystems of the complex system. This way of thinking has repercussions in the efficiency, the performance and the sustainability because correlating interactions is possible to find problems or improve the solutions.
- Cibernetics: it gives the concept of control, which is tied to dinamic systems. Those two things (dinamics systems and control) can contribute in the efficiency and the performance of better desitions (aka correctives) to maintain the system in a certain level of control stability. Also is important to talk about feedback, which is the information captured from subsystems or a external factors not related to the system.
- Artifitial intelligence (AI): it contributes specially in the performance, allowing the system to process the captured information and making numerical representation to find patterns and output better desition, and at the end to improve the systems behaviour (according to the goal).
So, in synthesis I think I can use tools like holistics to correlate interactions, AI to find patterns and improve behavior, and cibernetics with the perceptions (data) of interal or exteral factors (variables).
