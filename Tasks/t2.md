# Question
What are the key challenges and benefits of applying systems thinking to the analysis and design of complex systems?

Well, systems thinking is about making sense of the complexity of the world by looking it in a whole way, and focusing in the relationships rather than breaking the system into its parts. So, in short words it means to take a holistic point of view.
Taking the approach mentioned ealier can be challenging, because is necessary to understand the problem to make a good analysis and generate a good design. I think that the key challenges are related to the relations, because to identify how a subsystem relates to another, how one subsystem reacts to one change in another one is necessery to make a wise methodoly that allows to have accurate (as posible) sight of that system (the one that solves the problem). And, also allows to undertand how a input spreads throw the whole system and the effects in it.
On the other hand, the benefics are really valuable, because we will get a good undertanding of that system, how it works, how the parts or the subsystems relate between them, how the input propagates throw the system and its reactions. So, in short the feedback of the system will be much better.
What that means? It means that our system will perform better.
Why? Because the system is getting a more complete undertanting of the world (the medium/environment that involves the problem). And because if we undertand the problem from that POV (the holistic one), the solution we will build (the analisys, the design, etc) will come near to the best solution or will become the best one due to nature of systems thinking.
