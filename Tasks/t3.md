Topics:
- Better desitions
- Better results
- Results with a processing background
- A reactive system
- Learn from the env

If artificial intelligence and cybernetics are integrated in the process of decition-making, there are several ways it can empower that process, enriching it with the features that those two study fields (AI and cybernetics) provide.
The artifitial intelligence can provide features related with information processing, the events that occour in that dynamic system are information that needs to be filtered to extract the chunck linked to the topic of interest for that desition-making process. The filtered information provide useful data and facts that can be processed to get conclutions or helpul outputs enhancing better desitions. Also, the artifial intelligence provide another importante feature, which consists of learning, that learning have a knowledge base that also improves the desitions and that enrichs from the data provided by the dynamic environment.
On the other hand, cybernatics provides its main feature which is related to be reactive to changes, in this case those changes happens in the dynamic environment. What that means, is that cybernetics allows to have the interchange of information with the decisions of the the decision-making itself that triggers or responds to changes in the dinamic environment.
To conclude, it is possible to state that AI and cybernetics enhance the decistion-making process providing and complenting its features, getting decisions with a data processing background, and desicions that are consistently related to events or changes in the dinamic system.
