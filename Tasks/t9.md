# Question

What are the critical factors to consider when developing models and tools for designing cybernetic systems, and how can their effectiveness be tested?

# Brainstorm

- Metrics
	- Time
	- Quality
	- Capibility
- Math model
- Patterns or constant behaviours
- Chaos
- Randomness
- Chaoric attractor
- Sensibility
- Adaptation

Critical factors are probably the most important part when developing models and tools in the design of cybernetic systems, because they determine, in large part, the success or failure of the development process. The failure or the success is defined by a set of metrics that measure how good or bad is the performance of the models and the tools.
In cybernetic systems, there are perhaps three main critical factors: Randomness, Chaos, and Chaotic attractors. Those factors are important because they establish the frontier between effective or weak development.
Randomness is a factor highly tied to numbers because numbers are what makes it possible to measure and establish relations between things (like phenomena or events). Also, randomness introduces probability, which is a great tool to analyze behaviors in numbers like distributions, patterns, or maybe expected values.
On the other side, chaos is about sensitivity to initial conditions, and it has more deterministic features, but not a completely predictable behavior.
Then, there are chaotic attractors which are behaviors that a dynamic system could have no matter the initial conditions, they are not exactly the same behavior, but they have great similarities.
Those factors should be considered because to understand and effectively model a dynamic system is necessary to find patterns in its chaos to establish predictable behavior in the design of the cybernetic system.
The way to establish the effectiveness of the models and the tools is through metrics in the implementation of the cybernetic system (because that is where the design expresses the consideration of those factors during the development process). Those metrics can be about the time of making decisions/actions, the quality of those decisions/actions, or complete behaviors like survivance time (in some cases) or the quality of the strategy adopted.

Critical factors probably are the most important part when developing models and tools in the desing of cybernetic systems, becuase they determine in large part the success or the failure of the development process. The failure or the success is defined by a set of metrics that measure how good or bad is the performance of the models and the tools.
In cybernetic systems there are perphaps three main critical factors: Randomness, Chaos and Chaoric attractors. Thouse factor are really important because the stablish the frotier between a effective or a weak development.
The randomness is a factor highly tied to numbers, because numbers is what makes possible to measure and stablish relations between things (like phenomenons or events). Also, randomness intruduces the probability, that is a great tool to analyze behaviours in numbers like distributions, patterns or maybe expected values.
In the other side, the chaos is about sesitivity to initial conditions, and it has more deterministic features, but not a complete predictible behaviour.
An then, there are chaoric attractors that are behaviours that a dynamic system could have no matter the initial contidition, they are not exactly the same behaviour, but they have great simlarities.
Those factors should be cosidered because to understand and effectibly model a dynamic system is neccesery to find patterns in it's chaos to stablish predictible behavior in the design of the cybernetic system.
The way to stablish the effectiness of the models and the tools is through metrics in the implementation of the cybernetic system (because there is where the design expreses the considereation of those factors during the develpment process). Those metrics can be about the time of making a desitions/actions, the quality of thouse desitions/actions, or complete behavours like survivence time (in some cases) or the quality of the strategy adopted.
